# DSCP Lang Flows

DSCP is a _domain-specific-language_ ( DSL ) for designing **[token process flows](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-documentation/blob/main/docs/tokenModels/language.md)**. This new way of doing flows has a compiler for automatically generating process **[guard rails](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-documentation/blob/main/docs/tokenModels/guardRails.md)** using a purpose built compiler.

The **`dscp-lang`**, tool we use for parsing token flows, can be found in the **[dscp-node](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-node)** repository.
