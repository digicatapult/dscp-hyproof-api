# DSCP Lang Flows

This is just a summary of the toke flow for this project ( as in, information about the high-level DSCP Lang flow and the low level JSON flow which is derived from the previous one ). For more information, please refer to the main documentation repository ( **[dscp-documentation/tree/main/docs/hyproof](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-documentation/tree/main/docs/hyproof)** ).

## DSCP Lang Flows: Structure

Available files:

* The high-level version of the process flow written using the DSCP Lang can be found here:
  - ROOT **[./prototyping/dscp-lang-flows/hyproof-token-flows.dscp](./hyproof-token-flows.dscp)**

* The outputted json array here containing all the rules can be found here:
  - ROOT **[./hyproof-token-flows.json](../../hyproof-token-flows.json)**

For testing, one option would be to use the **[PolkadotJsApp GUI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/)** or any other methods like the SDK.
